<H2>Operations - Environment</H2>
<P>
When looking at how to make a reality of the strategy, the classic SWOT analysis is a good way to continue because it bridges the external and internal environments.  Your organisation’s strengths and weaknesses are likely to be largely internal, but threats and opportunities may come from both inside and outside.  You’ve probably seen a SWOT grid before, but for convenience there’s a simple template to use here.
