<P>
How many of the audience will come back after the interval?  Like Stravinsky’s Rites of Spring, will the audience be ready for it.  
<P>
An annual planning tool is a good way to test the readiness of your team to produce – and to link to intelligence arising from market research or user acceptance testing.  
<P>
Use the QfD at level 2 to produce Value Stream Analysis, identify silos, reuse and potential stream blockers.
<P>
Use the A3 templates to identify problems at team level. Prepare inititives and colutions to fit into team work flow. Report on the absorption phase.
