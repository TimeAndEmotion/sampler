<h2>Team - Absorption</h2>
<P>
This is the process of letting new learning filter-through and identifying what is of real value, often over the classic six-week period.  
<P></P>
The time allows for meaningful internal quality evaluation – working out what works for you.  
<P></P>
Via Kanban, this ties-in to quality control – as you can stop the production line, insert new learning, and restart.  Stand-alone Agile projects don’t always provide enough time to unlearn old ways, learn new ways and absorb real learning – so this toolkit provides a longer time-frame.
<P></P>
Absproption is the value realised at team and possibly individual levels. When done properly the effects bubble up to strateguc leves.
