<h2>Teams - Plan</h2>
<P>
This is where you look ahead, typically for a quarter or half a year, to see if your team and network are still fit for purpose.  
<P></P>
Is the orchestra still able to play in tune, and are the audience still in the auditorium to hear it?  
<P></P>
Sometimes an orchestra can play without a conductor, but they have to work harder to self-organise – this is easier for a small band, of course.  
<P></P>
Revisit the planning tool your team already uses – is it still playing the right tuner or does it need a remix?  If so, here are some further thinking tools with which to approach turning plan into performance; do the samples ring a bell?
