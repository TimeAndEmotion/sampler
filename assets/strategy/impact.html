<h2>Strategy - Value</h2>
<P>
Impact here can be in terms of how far this product realises the benefits of the existing strategy – or moves the strategy on afresh. 
<P>
You can use this tool to summarise benefits realised.  
<P>
If you spot ‘emergent strategy’ ideas while doing so, hold onto them; they will be useful in the next stage of the toolkit’s process.
