<h2>Strategy - Creative</h2>
<P>
This is often where resistance to creativity starts; it can be seen as a risk rather than opportunity.  The Creative Technique Library offers a number of tools for relating creativity to strategic goals.  The need for six-week cycles may take some selling, though.  Pick a tool from the library which looks right for your strategic audience â€“ if in doubt the Strategic Choice Approach may be a good one to try first.
