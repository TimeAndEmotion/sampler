<h2>Strategy - Environment</h2>
<P>
At a strategic level, it makes sense to start with the external environment.  This defines why the organisation exists in the first place â€“ and, often, why it needs to change.  A simple breakdown tool to identify the risks and opportunities is the STEPLE analysis, looking at social, technological economic, political, legal and ethical factors (NB STEP, PEST, PESTLE and STEEPLE are variants on the same theme).
