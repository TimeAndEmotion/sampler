<h2>Strategy - Plan</h2>
<P>
Your team leaders, and indeed teams members, have to understand their part in the overall strategy – or it’s no overall strategy at all.Is your outfit like an old school record company, or more like a modern music publisher making its money from live performances?  How do you keep the talent of performers while your strategy evolves?  A three-year planning tool like this can be useful in gauging whether your strategy-forming, and strategy communications, are up to the job?Claims made for business strategy can seem like a lot of hot air.  But how hot and strong is that hot air – balmy zephyr, atomic blast, or somewhere in between.  Weath
